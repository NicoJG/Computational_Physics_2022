Exercise C4: Writing a simple library
====

In this task you are suppose to write a small tools file that contains
useful functions.
This file can be used through out this course, for your convenience.
The input and output of the functions are both defined in the tools.c and
tools.h.
Complete the functions, then run the test to make sure that you have
implemented the functions correctly.
The makefiles and project structure is something that you can reuse throughout
the course.

Functions that are to be written
 * elementwise_addition
 * elementwise_multiplication
 * dot_product
 * create_2D_array
 * destroy_2D_array
 * matrix_multiplcation
 * vector_norm
 * normalize_vector
 * average
 * standard_deviation
 * distance_between_vectors
